/**
 * Although at one time a simple public variable object, the Social became an environmental
 * when it became import to be able to pass it as a tool of a message for various purposes.
 * It still retains much of its original awkwardness as can be seen in the method names.
 * Today the social is still mostly a variable storage unit, with a few methods to make use
 * of those variables.  
 * 
 * A social object exists not simply as one for each social command (smile, wiggy) but one
 * for each social variation (smile, smile self, smile bob).  The Name() field holds the
 * full unique name of each social object, with ID only having "DefaultSocial".
