@MudInfo?NAME@ supports email!  

If you enable autoforwarding, email sent to playername@@MudInfo?DOMAIN@ by other players will be forwarded to your real email address automatically.  Giving a real email address also allows you to retrieve your password if you forget it.  Your real address is kept secret, of course.
