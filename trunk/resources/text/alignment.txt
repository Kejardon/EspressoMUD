^gYour ^Halignment^? represents your moral fiber, with ^cGood^? representing selfless benevolence, ^rEvil^? representing selfish maliciousness, and ^wNeutral^? representing the balance of the two.^N

In combat, the amount of ^!experience^? you receive from the vanquishing of a foe depends entirely on your alignment versus that of the creature you have killed.  In general, if you are Good and you kill a Good creature, or Evil and kill an Evil creature, or Neutral and kill a Neutral creature, you receive NO experience.  The amount of experience can vary depending upon how close to perfect Goodness, perfect Evil, or pure Neutrality you are.  In addition to receiving no experience for violating this rule, you will find your characters alignment slowly changing with each repeat offense.

For some classes, alignment can have other affects.  ^!Paladins^? must always be good, and will find that their spellcasting ability disappears with their goodness.  ^!Druids^? must always be neutral, and will suffer if they stray.  ^!Clerics^? may be good or evil, but their spell choices can profoundly impact their alignment.  A Good Cleric or Paladin who casts malicious spells will soon find themselves becoming evil.  Evil Clerics can suffer the same fate for using benevolent spells.^N
